<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm from a smalltown in Iowa called Cumberland. It had a population of 500.
  No one else I grew up with really had an affinity for computers like me.
  I have always found them fascinating and that has drove me to also go to
  go to school for software development. Software development especially caught
  my attention because it was sort of a challenge for me and it really pushed
  me. I fell in love with satisfaction of fixing a problem when you are coding.
